Standard keyboards are the most common types. These days, standard keyboards come with multimedia keys besides the standard set of 104 keys. Gaming keyboards are for the purpose of gaming which incorporate the multimedia keys as well as other special keys for gaming.\n\n
Ergonomic keyboards are designed to position your hands naturally and reduce strain by offering a proper wrist rest to maximize comfort. They sure are pricey but they are worth the money. Opt. for an ergonomic keyboard if you suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n
Those who use their computer in the dark might prefer the keyboard with illumination. Those who focus on portability might want to get a flexible, foldable keyboard that doesnâ€™t take much space in their bags. For those prone to accident, keyboards that can resist liquid are available in the market.\n\n
For those concerned with comfort, keyboards with split-style design or with a proper wrist rest pad might be the thing for them. For programmers, the keyboard in DVORAK layout is better than the standard QWERTY layout. There are washable keyboards available for those obsessed with cleanliness.\n\n
Many manufactures have poured lots of clever ideas into their keyboard designs. Choose the one designed to meet your requirements.
